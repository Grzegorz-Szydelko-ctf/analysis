\# Analysis of Cybersecurity Incidents Handled by CERT Polska (2015 - 2024)



This is my first data analysis project, created as part of my learning process. I am continuously developing my analytical and technical skills.



The aim of the project was to analyze incidents handled by Cert Polska, identify the dominant categories, trends and and attempt to make a forecast of future incidents volumes. The dataset comes from annual CERT Polska „Krajobraz bezpieczeństwa polskiego Internetu” reports.



Used tools:

Excel,

Google Sheets,

Polynomial regression calculator (https://stats.blue/Stats\_Suite/polynomial\_regression\_calculator.html)





\## Executive Summary



The number of incidents handled by CERT Polska has increased from ~1,400 in 2015 to over103,000 in 2024. The dominant category is vulnerable services, which account for almost 95%of all incidents handled. Other categories of incidents, although less frequent, also requireattention and monitoring because they pose a real threat. Based on conservative andpolynomial forecast, the total incident volume may reach 257,000-457,000 by 2029. Thisindicates escalating treat levels and increasing operational load for incident response teams.
